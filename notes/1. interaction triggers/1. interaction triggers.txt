There are 3 kinds of interaction triggers:
- obj_editor_trigger_constantCollide (Triggers constantly when colliding)
- obj_editor_trigger_singleUseOnCollide (Triggers one time when the player collides)
- obj_editor_trigger_0nCollide (Triggers only when the player enters it.)
- obj_editor_trigger_onInteract (Triggers once when E is pressed)

all of these triggers basically work on the same principal. Any time it's triggered, it calls a function
called "interactEvent()" which is a function defined in the creation code event in the room editor.

Here is an example of an interact event:

interactEvent=function(){
	show_debug_message("Interacted!")	
}

The following code outputs "Interacted!" into the console.
